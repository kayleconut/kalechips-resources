<h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
  
<p>This is a very stripped-down blog (or whatever else) layout inspired by the reader mode that comes in most browsers. There are only a few lines of code at the very top of the CSS that you need to edit to change colors or fonts.</p>

<p>If you use Zonelets, the stylesheet is compatible with the base HTML. You can just copy the stylesheet of this page into your style.css file and you'll be good to go. If you don't use Zonelets, you can copy the entire source and proceed as normal. There are some bits of CSS in there that are only there for Zonelets, and they can be safely removed or ignored depending on how confident you are with poking around in the code.</p>
